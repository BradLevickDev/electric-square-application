- sound effects are associated with 'on mouse press' event rather than 'on mouse release' event.

- There is no UI navigation sound effect when clicking on the energy counter.

- In 'collection' when car reaches Max in tuning level, the Tuning kit UI button is blacked out. 
Clicking on another car in th collection causes a graphical bug whereby the default information
panel is the 'upgrade kits' panel. The rollover effect is present on the tuning kits button 
as well as the highlight indicator on the 'upgrade kits' button.

Clicking on either makes it revert to normal. Polish fix.
